    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>I'm Marcus Lazaro, a student at Bellevue College studying for a BAS in Software Development Application
        Development. Interested in
        expanding IT experience by getting involved in Web Development whether it's Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack
        positions. Open for other possibilities within the realm of Information Technology.</p>

    <p>Links below will guide you to specific projects I worked on in Bellevue College as well as a few personal
        projects</p>
